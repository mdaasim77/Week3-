    </h1>
    <h4>
        Using semantic tags in webpages offers several benefits:
    </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Accessibility: Semantic tags provide a clear and meaningful structure to web content, making it more accessible to people with disabilities. Screen readers and other assistive technologies rely on semantic HTML to interpret and convey the content accurately to users with visual impairments or cognitive disabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
            SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Search engines place importance on the structure and organization of web content. Semantic tags help search engines understand the hierarchy and relevance of different sections, improving the chances of higher search rankings. Properly structured content using semantic tags can enhance the visibility and discoverability of a webpage.
        </li>
        <li>Code Maintenance and Readability: Semantic tags make the HTML code more readable and easier to maintain. By using tags such as &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;, it becomes easier for developers to identify and modify specific sections of the webpage during maintenance or updates.

        </li>
        <li>  
            Future Compatibility: Semantic tags have semantic meaning, which makes them more future-proof. As new technologies, devices, and browsing contexts emerge, semantic HTML provides a solid foundation for adaptability and compatibility across different platforms and environments.
            
        </li>
        <li>
            Developer Collaboration: Semantic tags enhance collaboration among developers working on a project. By using consistent and standardized semantic tags, it becomes easier for team members to understand and navigate the structure of the webpage, improving teamwork and code maintainability.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>In summary, using semantic tags in webpages improves accessibility, SEO, code maintainability, future compatibility, developer collaboration, and user experience. By embracing semantic HTML, developers can create more inclusive, efficient, and well-structured web content.
