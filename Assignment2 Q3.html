            Web accessibility refers to the inclusive practice of designing and developing websites and web content in a way that ensures equal access and usability for all users, including people with disabilities. It aims to eliminate barriers that prevent individuals with disabilities from effectively navigating, perceiving, interacting, and contributing to the web.

            <li>Screen Readers: Screen readers are software applications that read aloud the text on a web page, making it accessible to individuals with visual impairments. They provide auditory output and allow users to navigate the web using keyboard commands.

            <li> Voice Recognition Software: Voice recognition software, also known as speech recognition software, allows users to interact with a website using voice commands instead of typing or using a mouse. It is particularly beneficial for individuals with mobility impairments or those who have difficulty using a keyboard or mouse.</li>
            
            <li>  Switch Devices: Switch devices are assistive devices that enable individuals with limited motor skills to interact with the web.
