    <h1>Q1: List out the feature of HTML5</h1> <br>
    <h2>HTML5 introduced several new features and enhancements over its predecessor, HTML4. Some of the key features of HTML5 include:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Semantic Elements: HTML5 introduced new semantic elements such as &lt; header&gt;, &lt; nav&gt;, &lt; footer&gt;, &lt; section&gt;, &lt; article&gt;, &lt; aside&gt;, and more. These elements provide a clearer structure and meaning to web page content, making it easier for search engines and assistive technologies to understand and navigate the page&lt;</li>
        <li>Multimedia Support: HTML5 introduced native support for multimedia elements like &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt;. These elements allow embedding audio and video content directly into web pages without the need for third-party plugins, such as Flash.</li>
        <li>Canvas Element: The &lt;canvas&gt; element introduced in HTML5 provides a drawing surface that allows developers to create dynamic and interactive graphics, animations, and games using JavaScript.</li>
        <li>Geolocation: HTML5 provides a Geolocation API that allows web applications to access the user's geographical location information, with the user's permission. This feature enables location-aware web applications and services.</li>
        <li>Offline Web Applications: HTML5 introduced the Application Cache feature, which allows web applications to work offline or in low-connectivity scenarios. Developers can specify which files should be cached and made available even when the user is offline.</li>
        <li>Form Enhancements: HTML5 introduced new input types, attributes, and validation features, making it easier to create robust and user-friendly forms. Examples include input types like email, url, date, number, and attributes like required, pattern, and more.</li>
        <li>Improved Accessibility: HTML5 includes several accessibility features and attributes, such as aria-* attributes, which help developers create more accessible web content for users with disabilities.</li>
        <li>Enhanced CSS Support: HTML5 expanded CSS support, allowing developers to use new CSS3 features for styling and layout, including selectors, animations, transitions, and more.</li>
        <li>Web Storage: HTML5 introduced the Web Storage API, which provides a way to store data locally on the client-side, persisting even after the browser is closed. It offers more storage capacity compared to traditional cookies.</li>
        <li>Web Workers: HTML5 introduced Web Workers, which allow developers to run JavaScript code in the background, separate from the main user interface thread. This feature enables multi-threaded JavaScript applications, improving performance and responsiveness.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>These are just some of the features introduced by HTML5, which have significantly enhanced the capabilities of web development and enriched the user experience on the web.</h3>
