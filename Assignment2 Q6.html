   </h1>
    <p>
        Here are five commonly used semantic tags in HTML along with their descriptions:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
           <b> &lt;header&gt;:</b> The &lt;header&gt; element represents the introductory content or a container for a group of introductory content at the beginning of a section or page. It typically includes the site or section title, logo, navigation, or other header-related elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>  &lt;nav&gt;:</b> The &lt;nav&gt; element represents a section of a page that contains navigation links. It is used to define a navigation menu or a set of navigation links that allow users to navigate within the website or to different sections of the page.

        </li>
        <li>
              
          <b>  &lt;main&gt;:</b> The &lt;main&gt; element represents the main content area of a document or a section of a document. It should contain the primary content that is unique to the document or section, excluding headers, footers, navigation, or sidebars.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>  &lt;section&gt;:</b> The &lt;section&gt; element represents a thematic grouping of content within a document or a section of a document. It is often used to divide a page into different sections or topics, providing a logical and structural organization of content.
            
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>  &lt;footer&gt;:</b> The &lt;footer&gt; element represents the footer of a document, section, or article. It typically contains information such as copyright notices, author attribution, contact information, related links, or other metadata relevant to the content or the website.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        These semantic tags provide a structural and meaningful representation of the content, making it easier for search engines, screen readers, and other assistive technologies to understand and navigate the web page. By using these semantic tags appropriately, you enhance the accessibility, usability, and maintainability of your HTML documents.
