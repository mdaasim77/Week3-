    <h1>Q4: List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of hTMl.</h1>
    <p>Here are three ways to improve the accessibility of HTML:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Use Semantic HTML: Utilize the appropriate semantic elements to structure your HTML content. Semantic elements like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;article&gt; provide meaningful information to assistive technologies and search engines. By using semantic elements correctly, you enhance the accessibility and understanding of your web content.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Provide Alternative Text for Images: Include descriptive alternative text (alt text) for images using the alt attribute. Alt text provides a textual description of the image for users who are visually impaired or have images disabled. It allows screen readers to convey the content and context of the image to those users.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Use Proper Form Labels: Ensure that all form elements have associated labels using the &lt;label&gt; element. Labels provide a clear description of the purpose of each form field, making it easier for screen reader users to understand and complete the form. Use the for attribute on the &lt;label&gt; element to associate it with the corresponding form field using the id attribute.
        </li>
        <br>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        By implementing these practices, you can significantly improve the accessibility of your HTML content, making it more inclusive and usable for all users, including those with disabilities.
